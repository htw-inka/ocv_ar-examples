/**
 The CCBReader loads node graphs created by SpriteBuilder (or other editors using the same format). If you are using SpriteBuilder it's strongly recommended that you set up the CCFileUtils using the configureCCFileUtils method or use the Xcode project file created by SpriteBuilder.
 
 Load your SpriteBuilder files using the load: method, if you are loading a scene use the loadAsScene: method, which will wrap the loaded node graph in a CCScene object.
 
 You can optionally pass an owner object to the CCBReader. If you have assigned member variables in your ccb-files to the owner, they will be set on the owner object when the file is loaded.
 
 When all loading is complete, the didLoadFromCCB method will be called on all loaded nodes (if it has been implemented).
 
 If you are using animations a CCAnimationManager will be assigned to all ccb-file root node's animationManager property. The top CCAnimationManager is also assigned to the CCBReader's animationManager property.
