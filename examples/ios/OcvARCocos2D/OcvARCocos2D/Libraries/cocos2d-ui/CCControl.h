 CCControl is the abstract base class of the Cocos2d components that handles touches or mouse events. You cannot instantiate it directly, instead use one of its sub-classes, such as CCButton. If you need to create a new sort of component you should make a sub-class of this class.
 
 The control class handles events and its sub-classes will use child nodes to draw itself in the node heirarchy.
 
 *Important:* If you are sub-classing CCControl you will need to include the CCControlSubclass.h file as it includes methods that are otherwise not exposed.
